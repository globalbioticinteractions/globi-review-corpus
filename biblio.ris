AB  - Introduction

Data Review and Archive

Data review and archiving can be a time-consuming process, especially
when done manually. This review report aims to help facilitate both
activities. It automates the archiving of datasets, including Darwin
Core archives, and is a citable backup of a version of the dataset.
Additionally, an automatic review of species interaction claims made in
the dataset is generated and registered with Global Biotic Interactions
(J. H. Poelen, Simons,
and Mungall 2014).

This review includes summary statistics about, and observations
about, the dataset under review:

Biotic Interactions




Biotic Interaction Data
Model


In this review, biotic interactions (or biotic associations) are
modeled as a primary (aka subject, source) organism interacting with an
associate (aka object, target) organism. The dataset under review
classified the primary/associate organisms with specific taxa. The
primary and associate organisms The kind of interaction is documented as
an interaction type.

The dataset under review, named GoMexSI/interaction-data, has
fingerprint hash://md5/85e90297735515115672dbef864b08e2, is 30.5MiB in
size and contains 74,304 interaction with 1 unique type of association
(e.g., eats) between 484 primary taxa (e.g., Istiophorus platypterus)
and 1,958 associated taxon (e.g., Actinopterygii).

An exhaustive list of indexed interaction claims can be found in
gzipped csv and tsv archives. To facilitate
discovery, a preview of claims available in the gzipped html page at indexed-interactions.html.gz are
shown below.

The exhaustive list was used to create the following data summaries
below.

Interaction Networks

The figures below provide a graph view on the dataset under review.
The first shows a summary network on the kingdom level, and the second
shows how interactions on the family level. It is important to note that
both network graphs were first aligned taxonomically using the Catalogue
of Life. Please refer to the original (or verbatim) taxonomic names for
a more original view on the interaction data.

Taxonomic Alignment

As part of the review, all names are aligned against various name
catalogs (e.g., col, ncbi, discoverlife, gbif, itis, wfo, mdd, tpt,
pbdb, and worms). These alignments can help review name usage or aid in
selecting of a suitable taxonomic name resource.

Note that if the badge is green, no review notes were generated. If
the badge is yellow, the review bots may need some help with
interpreting the species interaction data.

GloBI Index Badge

If the dataset under review has been registered with
GloBI, and has been succesfully indexed by GloBI, the GloBI Index
Status Badge will turn green. This means that the dataset under review
was indexed by GloBI and is available through GloBI services and derived
data products.

Discussion

This review and archive provides a means of creating citable versions
of datasets that change frequently. This may be useful for dataset
managers, including natural history collection data managers, as a
backup archive of a shared Darwin Core archive. It also serves as a
means of creating a trackable citation for the dataset in an automated
way, while also including some information about the contents of the
dataset.

This review aims to provide a perspective on the dataset to aid in
understanding of species interaction claims discovered. However, it is
important to note that this review does not assess the quality
of the dataset. Instead, it serves as an indication of the open-ness6 and FAIRness (Wilkinson et
al. 2016; Trekels et al. 2023) of the dataset: to perform this
review, the data was likely openly available, Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable and
Reusable. The current Open-FAIR assessment is
qualitative, and a more quantitative approach can be implemented with
specified measurement units.

This report also showcases the reuse of machine-actionable
(meta)data, something highly recommended by the FAIR Data Principles
(Wilkinson et al.
2016). Making (meta)data machine-actionable enables more precise
procesing by computers, enabling even naive review bots like Nomer and
Elton to interpret the data effectively. This capability is crucial for
not just automating the generation of reports, but also for facilitating
seamless data exchanges, promoting interoperability.

AB  - Introduction

Data Review and Archive

Data review and archiving can be a time-consuming process, especially
when done manually. This review report aims to help facilitate both
activities. It automates the archiving of datasets, including Darwin
Core archives, and is a citable backup of a version of the dataset.
Additionally, an automatic review of species interaction claims made in
the dataset is generated and registered with Global Biotic Interactions
(J. H. Poelen, Simons,
and Mungall 2014).

This review includes summary statistics about, and observations
about, the dataset under review:

Biotic Interactions




Biotic Interaction Data
Model


In this review, biotic interactions (or biotic associations) are
modeled as a primary (aka subject, source) organism interacting with an
associate (aka object, target) organism. The dataset under review
classified the primary/associate organisms with specific taxa. The
primary and associate organisms The kind of interaction is documented as
an interaction type.

The dataset under review, named MariaFaticov/Insetbugs, has
fingerprint hash://md5/98f2c8bb64d5c2249eda3bc73d69a794, is 24.2KiB in
size and contains 11 interactions with 1 unique type of association
(e.g., parasiteOf) between 8 primary taxa (e.g., Leptoconchus
inpleuractis) and 11 associated taxa (e.g., Fungia (Cycloseris)
costulata).

An exhaustive list of indexed interaction claims can be found in
gzipped csv and tsv archives. To facilitate
discovery, a preview of claims available in the gzipped html page at indexed-interactions.html.gz are
shown below.

The exhaustive list was used to create the following data summaries
below.

Taxonomic Alignment

As part of the review, all names are aligned against various name
catalogs (e.g., col, ncbi, discoverlife, gbif, itis, wfo, mdd, tpt,
pbdb, and worms). These alignments can help review name usage or aid in
selecting of a suitable taxonomic name resource.

Additional Reviews

Elton, Nomer, and other tools may have difficulties interpreting
existing species interaction datasets. Or, they may misbehave, or
otherwise show unexpected behavior. As part of the review process,
detailed review notes are kept that document possibly misbehaving, or
confused, review bots. An sample of review notes associated with this
review can be found below.

Discussion

This review and archive provides a means of creating citable versions
of datasets that change frequently. This may be useful for dataset
managers, including natural history collection data managers, as a
backup archive of a shared Darwin Core archive. It also serves as a
means of creating a trackable citation for the dataset in an automated
way, while also including some information about the contents of the
dataset.

This review aims to provide a perspective on the dataset to aid in
understanding of species interaction claims discovered. However, it is
important to note that this review does not assess the quality
of the dataset. Instead, it serves as an indication of the open-ness6 and FAIRness (Wilkinson et
al. 2016; Trekels et al. 2023) of the dataset: to perform this
review, the data was likely openly available, Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable and
Reusable. The current Open-FAIR assessment is
qualitative, and a more quantitative approach can be implemented with
specified measurement units.

This report also showcases the reuse of machine-actionable
(meta)data, something highly recommended by the FAIR Data Principles
(Wilkinson et al.
2016). Making (meta)data machine-actionable enables more precise
procesing by computers, enabling even naive review bots like Nomer and
Elton to interpret the data effectively. This capability is crucial for
not just automating the generation of reports, but also for facilitating
seamless data exchanges, promoting interoperability.

AB  - Introduction

Data Review and Archive

Data review and archiving can be a time-consuming process, especially
when done manually. This review report aims to help facilitate both
activities. It automates the archiving of datasets, including Darwin
Core archives, and is a citable backup of a version of the dataset.
Additionally, an automatic review of species interaction claims made in
the dataset is generated and registered with Global Biotic Interactions
(J. H. Poelen, Simons,
and Mungall 2014).

This review includes summary statistics about, and observations
about, the dataset under review:

Biotic Interactions




Biotic Interaction Data
Model


In this review, biotic interactions (or biotic associations) are
modeled as a primary (aka subject, source) organism interacting with an
associate (aka object, target) organism. The dataset under review
classified the primary/associate organisms with specific taxa. The
primary and associate organisms The kind of interaction is documented as
an interaction type.

The dataset under review, named
SternerLab/SternerLab-MammalVirusData, has fingerprint
hash://md5/e59000b00ce0a68a512828bfac0cc18b, is 6.34MiB in size and
contains 7,121 interaction with 1 unique type of association (e.g.,
interactsWith) between 169 primary taxa (e.g.,
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.10039) and 166
associated taxa (e.g., Mull, N., Schexnayder, A., Stolt, A., Sironen,
T., & Forbes, K. M. (2023). Effects of habitat management on rodent
diversity, abundance, and virus infection dynamics. Ecology and
evolution, 13(4), e10039. https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.10039).

An exhaustive list of indexed interaction claims can be found in
gzipped csv and tsv archives. To facilitate
discovery, a preview of claims available in the gzipped html page at indexed-interactions.html.gz are
shown below.

The exhaustive list was used to create the following data summaries

Additional Reviews

Elton, Nomer, and other tools may have difficulties interpreting
existing species interaction datasets. Or, they may misbehave, or
otherwise show unexpected behavior. As part of the review process,
detailed review notes are kept that document possibly misbehaving, or
confused, review bots. An sample of review notes associated with this
review can be found below.

Note that if the badge is green, no review notes were generated. If
the badge is yellow, the review bots may need some help with
interpreting the species interaction data.

GloBI Index Badge

If the dataset under review has been registered with
GloBI, and has been succesfully indexed by GloBI, the GloBI Index
Status Badge will turn green. This means that the dataset under review
was indexed by GloBI and is available through GloBI services and derived
data products.

Discussion

This review and archive provides a means of creating citable versions
of datasets that change frequently. This may be useful for dataset
managers, including natural history collection data managers, as a
backup archive of a shared Darwin Core archive. It also serves as a
means of creating a trackable citation for the dataset in an automated
way, while also including some information about the contents of the
dataset.

This review aims to provide a perspective on the dataset to aid in
understanding of species interaction claims discovered. However, it is
important to note that this review does not assess the quality
of the dataset. Instead, it serves as an indication of the open-ness6 and FAIRness (Wilkinson et
al. 2016; Trekels et al. 2023) of the dataset: to perform this
review, the data was likely openly available, Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable and
Reusable. The current Open-FAIR assessment is
qualitative, and a more quantitative approach can be implemented with
specified measurement units.

This report also showcases the reuse of machine-actionable
(meta)data, something highly recommended by the FAIR Data Principles
(Wilkinson et al.
2016). Making (meta)data machine-actionable enables more precise
procesing by computers, enabling even naive review bots like Nomer and
Elton to interpret the data effectively. This capability is crucial for
not just automating the generation of reports, but also for facilitating
seamless data exchanges, promoting interoperability.

Data Review and Archive

Data review and archiving can be a time-consuming process, especially
when done manually. This review report aims to help facilitate both
activities. It automates the archiving of datasets, including Darwin
Core archives, and is a citable backup of a version of the dataset.
Additionally, an automatic review of species interaction claims made in
the dataset is generated and registered with Global Biotic Interactions
(J. H. Poelen, Simons,
and Mungall 2014).

This review includes summary statistics about, and observations
about, the dataset under review:

Biotic Interactions




Biotic Interaction Data
Model


In this review, biotic interactions (or biotic associations) are
modeled as a primary (aka subject, source) organism interacting with an
associate (aka object, target) organism. The dataset under review
classified the primary/associate organisms with specific taxa. The
primary and associate organisms The kind of interaction is documented as
an interaction type.

The dataset under review, named SternerLab/sterner2023, has
fingerprint hash://md5/e69f0af69e6e89722ca3434a60219f4f, is 6.34MiB in
size and contains 7,121 interaction with 1 unique type of association
(e.g., interactsWith) between 169 primary taxa (e.g.,
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.10039) and 166
associated taxa (e.g., Mull, N., Schexnayder, A., Stolt, A., Sironen,
T., & Forbes, K. M. (2023). Effects of habitat management on rodent
diversity, abundance, and virus infection dynamics. Ecology and
evolution, 13(4), e10039. https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.10039).

An exhaustive list of indexed interaction claims can be found in
gzipped csv and tsv archives. To facilitate
discovery, a preview of claims available in the gzipped html page at indexed-interactions.html.gz are
shown below.

The exhaustive list was used to create the following data summaries

Taxonomic Alignment

As part of the review, all names are aligned against various name
catalogs (e.g., col, ncbi, discoverlife, gbif, itis, wfo, mdd, tpt,
pbdb, and worms). These alignments can help review name usage or aid in
selecting of a suitable taxonomic name resource.

Additional Reviews

Elton, Nomer, and other tools may have difficulties interpreting
existing species interaction datasets. Or, they may misbehave, or
otherwise show unexpected behavior. As part of the review process,
detailed review notes are kept that document possibly misbehaving, or
confused, review bots. An sample of review notes associated with this
review can be found below.

Note that if the badge is green, no review notes were generated. If
the badge is yellow, the review bots may need some help with
interpreting the species interaction data.

GloBI Index Badge

If the dataset under review has been registered with
GloBI, and has been succesfully indexed by GloBI, the GloBI Index
Status Badge will turn green. This means that the dataset under review
was indexed by GloBI and is available through GloBI services and derived
data products.

Discussion

This review and archive provides a means of creating citable versions
of datasets that change frequently. This may be useful for dataset
managers, including natural history collection data managers, as a
backup archive of a shared Darwin Core archive. It also serves as a
means of creating a trackable citation for the dataset in an automated
way, while also including some information about the contents of the
dataset.

This review aims to provide a perspective on the dataset to aid in
understanding of species interaction claims discovered. However, it is
important to note that this review does not assess the quality
of the dataset. Instead, it serves as an indication of the open-ness6 and FAIRness (Wilkinson et
al. 2016; Trekels et al. 2023) of the dataset: to perform this
review, the data was likely openly available, Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable and
Reusable. The current Open-FAIR assessment is
qualitative, and a more quantitative approach can be implemented with
specified measurement units.

This report also showcases the reuse of machine-actionable
(meta)data, something highly recommended by the FAIR Data Principles
(Wilkinson et al.
2016). Making (meta)data machine-actionable enables more precise
procesing by computers, enabling even naive review bots like Nomer and
Elton to interpret the data effectively. This capability is crucial for
not just automating the generation of reports, but also for facilitating
seamless data exchanges, promoting interoperability.

AB  - Introduction

Data Review and Archive

Data review and archiving can be a time-consuming process, especially
when done manually. This review report aims to help facilitate both
activities. It automates the archiving of datasets, including Darwin
Core archives, and is a citable backup of a version of the dataset.
Additionally, an automatic review of species interaction claims made in
the dataset is generated and registered with Global Biotic Interactions
(J. H. Poelen, Simons,
and Mungall 2014).

This review includes summary statistics about, and observations
about, the dataset under review:

Biotic Interactions




Biotic Interaction Data
Model


In this review, biotic interactions (or biotic associations) are
modeled as a primary (aka subject, source) organism interacting with an
associate (aka object, target) organism. The dataset under review
classified the primary/associate organisms with specific taxa. The
primary and associate organisms The kind of interaction is documented as
an interaction type.

The dataset under review, named fkeck/gpt_interactions, has
fingerprint hash://md5/960ab16271f04b766ce79bcb9bcc5be7, is 231MiB in
size and contains 1,321,382 interaction with 16 unique types of
associations (e.g., pathogenOf) between 28,253 primary taxon (e.g.,
Eukaryota) and 26,857 associated taxon (e.g., Eukaryota).

An exhaustive list of indexed interaction claims can be found in
gzipped csv and tsv archives. To facilitate
discovery, a preview of claims available in the gzipped html page at indexed-interactions.html.gz are
shown below.

The exhaustive list was used to create the following data summaries
below.

Additional Reviews

Elton, Nomer, and other tools may have difficulties interpreting
existing species interaction datasets. Or, they may misbehave, or
otherwise show unexpected behavior. As part of the review process,
detailed review notes are kept that document possibly misbehaving, or
confused, review bots. An sample of review notes associated with this
review can be found below.

GloBI Review Badge

As part of the review, a review badge is generated. This review badge
can be included in webpages to indicate the review status of the dataset
under review.




Picture of a GloBI Review Badge 3


Note that if the badge is green, no review notes were generated. If
the badge is yellow, the review bots may need some help with
interpreting the species interaction data.

GloBI Index Badge

If the dataset under review has been registered with
GloBI, and has been succesfully indexed by GloBI, the GloBI Index
Status Badge will turn green. This means that the dataset under review
was indexed by GloBI and is available through GloBI services and derived
data products.

Discussion

This review and archive provides a means of creating citable versions
of datasets that change frequently. This may be useful for dataset
managers, including natural history collection data managers, as a
backup archive of a shared Darwin Core archive. It also serves as a
means of creating a trackable citation for the dataset in an automated
way, while also including some information about the contents of the
dataset.

This review aims to provide a perspective on the dataset to aid in
understanding of species interaction claims discovered. However, it is
important to note that this review does not assess the quality
of the dataset. Instead, it serves as an indication of the open-ness6 and FAIRness (Wilkinson et
al. 2016; Trekels et al. 2023) of the dataset: to perform this
review, the data was likely openly available, Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable and
Reusable. The current Open-FAIR assessment is
qualitative, and a more quantitative approach can be implemented with
specified measurement units.

This report also showcases the reuse of machine-actionable
(meta)data, something highly recommended by the FAIR Data Principles
(Wilkinson et al.
2016). Making (meta)data machine-actionable enables more precise
procesing by computers, enabling even naive review bots like Nomer and
Elton to interpret the data effectively. This capability is crucial for
not just automating the generation of reports, but also for facilitating
seamless data exchanges, promoting interoperability.

Acknowledgements

We thank the many humans that created us and those who created and
maintained the data, software and other intellectual resources that were
used for producing this review. In addition, we are grateful for the
natural resources providing the basis for these human and bot
activities. Also, thanks to https://github.com/zygoballus for helping
improve the layout of the review tables.

Author contributions

AB  - Introduction

Data Review and Archive

Data review and archiving can be a time-consuming process, especially
when done manually. This review report aims to help facilitate both
activities. It automates the archiving of datasets, including Darwin
Core archives, and is a citable backup of a version of the dataset.
Additionally, an automatic review of species interaction claims made in
the dataset is generated and registered with Global Biotic Interactions
(J. H. Poelen, Simons,
and Mungall 2014).

This review includes summary statistics about, and observations
about, the dataset under review:

Biotic Interactions




Biotic Interaction Data
Model


In this review, biotic interactions (or biotic associations) are
modeled as a primary (aka subject, source) organism interacting with an
associate (aka object, target) organism. The dataset under review
classified the primary/associate organisms with specific taxa. The
primary and associate organisms The kind of interaction is documented as
an interaction type.

The dataset under review, named globalbioticinteractions/bpbm-ent,
has fingerprint hash://md5/7d8a51c342eb3f0b4c8bd61bff8196bd, is 151MiB
in size and contains 26,438 interaction with 3 unique types of
associations (e.g., adjacentTo) between 8,301 primary taxon (e.g.,
Fungi) and 14,743 associated taxon (e.g., rocks).

An exhaustive list of indexed interaction claims can be found in
gzipped csv and tsv archives. To facilitate
discovery, a preview of claims available in the gzipped html page at indexed-interactions.html.gz are
shown below.

The exhaustive list was used to create the following data summaries
below.

Additional Reviews

Elton, Nomer, and other tools may have difficulties interpreting
existing species interaction datasets. Or, they may misbehave, or
otherwise show unexpected behavior. As part of the review process,
detailed review notes are kept that document possibly misbehaving, or
confused, review bots. An sample of review notes associated with this
review can be found below.

Discussion

This review and archive provides a means of creating citable versions
of datasets that change frequently. This may be useful for dataset
managers, including natural history collection data managers, as a
backup archive of a shared Darwin Core archive. It also serves as a
means of creating a trackable citation for the dataset in an automated
way, while also including some information about the contents of the
dataset.

This review aims to provide a perspective on the dataset to aid in
understanding of species interaction claims discovered. However, it is
important to note that this review does not assess the quality
of the dataset. Instead, it serves as an indication of the open-ness6 and FAIRness (Wilkinson et
al. 2016; Trekels et al. 2023) of the dataset: to perform this
review, the data was likely openly available, Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable and
Reusable. The current Open-FAIR assessment is
qualitative, and a more quantitative approach can be implemented with
specified measurement units.

This report also showcases the reuse of machine-actionable
(meta)data, something highly recommended by the FAIR Data Principles
(Wilkinson et al.
2016). Making (meta)data machine-actionable enables more precise
procesing by computers, enabling even naive review bots like Nomer and
Elton to interpret the data effectively. This capability is crucial for
not just automating the generation of reports, but also for facilitating
seamless data exchanges, promoting interoperability.

AB  - Introduction

Data Review and Archive

Data review and archiving can be a time-consuming process, especially
when done manually. This review report aims to help facilitate both
activities. It automates the archiving of datasets, including Darwin
Core archives, and is a citable backup of a version of the dataset.
Additionally, an automatic review of species interaction claims made in
the dataset is generated and registered with Global Biotic Interactions
(J. H. Poelen, Simons,
and Mungall 2014).

This review includes summary statistics about, and observations
about, the dataset under review:

Biotic Interactions




Biotic Interaction Data
Model


In this review, biotic interactions (or biotic associations) are
modeled as a primary (aka subject, source) organism interacting with an
associate (aka object, target) organism. The dataset under review
classified the primary/associate organisms with specific taxa. The
primary and associate organisms The kind of interaction is documented as
an interaction type.

The dataset under review, named globalbioticinteractions/cas-ent, has
fingerprint hash://md5/a35c85b2774833d20679e8637cc7c5c3, is 13.6MiB in
size and contains 17,568 interaction with 5 unique types of associations
(e.g., interactsWith) between 2,141 primary taxon (e.g., Callidium
antennatum hesperum Casey, 1912) and 2,099 associated taxon (e.g.,
Pseudotsuga menziesii).

An exhaustive list of indexed interaction claims can be found in
gzipped csv and tsv archives. To facilitate
discovery, a preview of claims available in the gzipped html page at indexed-interactions.html.gz are
shown below.

The exhaustive list was used to create the following data summaries
below.

Discussion

This review and archive provides a means of creating citable versions
of datasets that change frequently. This may be useful for dataset
managers, including natural history collection data managers, as a
backup archive of a shared Darwin Core archive. It also serves as a
means of creating a trackable citation for the dataset in an automated
way, while also including some information about the contents of the
dataset.

This review aims to provide a perspective on the dataset to aid in
understanding of species interaction claims discovered. However, it is
important to note that this review does not assess the quality
of the dataset. Instead, it serves as an indication of the open-ness6 and FAIRness (Wilkinson et
al. 2016; Trekels et al. 2023) of the dataset: to perform this
review, the data was likely openly available, Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable and
Reusable. The current Open-FAIR assessment is
qualitative, and a more quantitative approach can be implemented with
specified measurement units.

This report also showcases the reuse of machine-actionable
(meta)data, something highly recommended by the FAIR Data Principles
(Wilkinson et al.
2016). Making (meta)data machine-actionable enables more precise
procesing by computers, enabling even naive review bots like Nomer and
Elton to interpret the data effectively. This capability is crucial for
not just automating the generation of reports, but also for facilitating
seamless data exchanges, promoting interoperability.

Acknowledgements

AB  - Life on Earth is sustained by complex interactions between organisms and their environment. These biotic interactions can be captured in datasets and published digitally. We present a review and archiving process for such an openly accessible digital interactions dataset of known origin and discuss its outcome. The dataset under review, named globalbioticinteractions/choy2017, has fingerprint hash://md5/3459af34b0f51c007fffe9351391e34e, is 27.1KiB in size and contains 223 interactions with 1 unique type of association (e.g., eats) between 70 primary taxa (e.g., Cuninidae) and 67 associated taxa (e.g., Euphausiacea). This report includes detailed summaries of interaction data, a taxonomic review from multiple catalogs, and an archived version of the dataset from which the reviews are derived.

AB  - Introduction

Data Review and Archive

Data review and archiving can be a time-consuming process, especially
when done manually. This review report aims to help facilitate both
activities. It automates the archiving of datasets, including Darwin
Core archives, and is a citable backup of a version of the dataset.
Additionally, an automatic review of species interaction claims made in
the dataset is generated and registered with Global Biotic Interactions
(J. H. Poelen, Simons,
and Mungall 2014).

This review includes summary statistics about, and observations
about, the dataset under review:

Biotic Interactions




Biotic Interaction Data
Model


In this review, biotic interactions (or biotic associations) are
modeled as a primary (aka subject, source) organism interacting with an
associate (aka object, target) organism. The dataset under review
classified the primary/associate organisms with specific taxa. The
primary and associate organisms The kind of interaction is documented as
an interaction type.

The dataset under review, named globalbioticinteractions/degroot2020,
has fingerprint hash://md5/9e6b4e0776530b5e41d14d042c33744b, is 182KiB
in size and contains 420 interactions with 2 unique types of
associations (e.g., hyperparasiteOf) between 96 primary taxa (e.g.,
Arthrorhynchus nycteribiae) and 117 associated taxa (e.g., Chiroptera
gen. & sp. indet.).

An exhaustive list of indexed interaction claims can be found in
gzipped csv and tsv archives. To facilitate
discovery, a preview of claims available in the gzipped html page at indexed-interactions.html.gz are
shown below.

The exhaustive list was used to create the following data summaries
below.

Additional Reviews

Elton, Nomer, and other tools may have difficulties interpreting
existing species interaction datasets. Or, they may misbehave, or
otherwise show unexpected behavior. As part of the review process,
detailed review notes are kept that document possibly misbehaving, or
confused, review bots. An sample of review notes associated with this

Discussion

This review and archive provides a means of creating citable versions
of datasets that change frequently. This may be useful for dataset
managers, including natural history collection data managers, as a
backup archive of a shared Darwin Core archive. It also serves as a
means of creating a trackable citation for the dataset in an automated
way, while also including some information about the contents of the
dataset.

This review aims to provide a perspective on the dataset to aid in
understanding of species interaction claims discovered. However, it is
important to note that this review does not assess the quality
of the dataset. Instead, it serves as an indication of the open-ness6 and FAIRness (Wilkinson et
al. 2016; Trekels et al. 2023) of the dataset: to perform this
review, the data was likely openly available, Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable and
Reusable. The current Open-FAIR assessment is
qualitative, and a more quantitative approach can be implemented with
specified measurement units.

This report also showcases the reuse of machine-actionable
(meta)data, something highly recommended by the FAIR Data Principles
(Wilkinson et al.
2016). Making (meta)data machine-actionable enables more precise
procesing by computers, enabling even naive review bots like Nomer and
Elton to interpret the data effectively. This capability is crucial for
not just automating the generation of reports, but also for facilitating
seamless data exchanges, promoting interoperability.

Data Review and Archive

Data review and archiving can be a time-consuming process, especially
when done manually. This review report aims to help facilitate both
activities. It automates the archiving of datasets, including Darwin
Core archives, and is a citable backup of a version of the dataset.
Additionally, an automatic review of species interaction claims made in
the dataset is generated and registered with Global Biotic Interactions
(J. H. Poelen, Simons,
and Mungall 2014).

This review includes summary statistics about, and observations
about, the dataset under review:

Biotic Interactions




Biotic Interaction Data
Model


In this review, biotic interactions (or biotic associations) are
modeled as a primary (aka subject, source) organism interacting with an
associate (aka object, target) organism. The dataset under review
classified the primary/associate organisms with specific taxa. The
primary and associate organisms The kind of interaction is documented as
an interaction type.

The dataset under review, named globalbioticinteractions/dugon2023,
has fingerprint hash://md5/a5569d8e866a78b3156b28604e022c0e, is 19.0KiB
in size and contains 9 interactions with 1 unique type of association
(e.g., preysOn) between 3 primary taxa (e.g., Steatoda triangulosa) and
9 associated taxa (e.g., Zootoca vivipara).

An exhaustive list of indexed interaction claims can be found in
gzipped csv and tsv archives. To facilitate
discovery, a preview of claims available in the gzipped html page at indexed-interactions.html.gz are
shown below.

The exhaustive list was used to create the following data summaries
below.

catalogs (e.g., col, ncbi, discoverlife, gbif, itis, wfo, mdd, tpt,
pbdb, and worms). These alignments can help review name usage or aid in
selecting of a suitable taxonomic name resource.

Name relationship types per catalog. Name relationship type
"NONE" means that a name was not recognized by the associated catalog.
"SAME_AS" indicates either a "HAS_ACCEPTED_NAME" or "SYNONYM_OF" name
relationship type. We recognize that "SYNONYM_OF" encompasses many types
of nomenclatural synonymies

Additional Reviews

Elton, Nomer, and other tools may have difficulties interpreting
existing species interaction datasets. Or, they may misbehave, or
otherwise show unexpected behavior. As part of the review process,
detailed review notes are kept that document possibly misbehaving, or
confused, review bots. An sample of review notes associated with this
review can be found below.

GloBI Review Badge

As part of the review, a review badge is generated. This review badge
can be included in webpages to indicate the review status of the dataset
under review.




Picture of a GloBI Review Badge 3


Note that if the badge is green, no review notes were generated. If
the badge is yellow, the review bots may need some help with
interpreting the species interaction data.

GloBI Index Badge

If the dataset under review has been registered with
GloBI, and has been succesfully indexed by GloBI, the GloBI Index
Status Badge will turn green. This means that the dataset under review
was indexed by GloBI and is available through GloBI services and derived
data products.

Discussion

This review and archive provides a means of creating citable versions
of datasets that change frequently. This may be useful for dataset
managers, including natural history collection data managers, as a
backup archive of a shared Darwin Core archive. It also serves as a
means of creating a trackable citation for the dataset in an automated
way, while also including some information about the contents of the
dataset.

This review aims to provide a perspective on the dataset to aid in
understanding of species interaction claims discovered. However, it is
important to note that this review does not assess the quality
of the dataset. Instead, it serves as an indication of the open-ness6 and FAIRness (Wilkinson et
al. 2016; Trekels et al. 2023) of the dataset: to perform this
review, the data was likely openly available, Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable and
Reusable. The current Open-FAIR assessment is
qualitative, and a more quantitative approach can be implemented with
specified measurement units.

This report also showcases the reuse of machine-actionable
(meta)data, something highly recommended by the FAIR Data Principles
(Wilkinson et al.
2016). Making (meta)data machine-actionable enables more precise
procesing by computers, enabling even naive review bots like Nomer and
Elton to interpret the data effectively. This capability is crucial for
not just automating the generation of reports, but also for facilitating
seamless data exchanges, promoting interoperability.

AB  - Introduction

Data Review and Archive

Data review and archiving can be a time-consuming process, especially
when done manually. This review report aims to help facilitate both
activities. It automates the archiving of datasets, including Darwin
Core archives, and is a citable backup of a version of the dataset.
Additionally, an automatic review of species interaction claims made in
the dataset is generated and registered with Global Biotic Interactions
(J. H. Poelen, Simons,
and Mungall 2014).

This review includes summary statistics about, and observations
about, the dataset under review:

Biotic Interactions




Biotic Interaction Data
Model


In this review, biotic interactions (or biotic associations) are
modeled as a primary (aka subject, source) organism interacting with an
associate (aka object, target) organism. The dataset under review
classified the primary/associate organisms with specific taxa. The
primary and associate organisms The kind of interaction is documented as
an interaction type.

The dataset under review, named globalbioticinteractions/guzman2022,
has fingerprint hash://md5/006bf04d154613cbd4f9a3710543097c, is 15.5MiB
in size and contains 34,949 interaction with 1 unique type of
association (e.g., pollinates) between 746 primary taxa (e.g., Apis
mellifera) and 472 associated taxa (e.g., Camassia quamash).

An exhaustive list of indexed interaction claims can be found in
gzipped csv and tsv archives. To facilitate
discovery, a preview of claims available in the gzipped html page at indexed-interactions.html.gz are
shown below.

The exhaustive list was used to create the following data summaries
below.

Additional Reviews

Elton, Nomer, and other tools may have difficulties interpreting
existing species interaction datasets. Or, they may misbehave, or
otherwise show unexpected behavior. As part of the review process,
detailed review notes are kept that document possibly misbehaving, or
confused, review bots. An sample of review notes associated with this
review can be found below.

Note that if the badge is green, no review notes were generated. If
the badge is yellow, the review bots may need some help with
interpreting the species interaction data.

GloBI Index Badge

If the dataset under review has been registered with
GloBI, and has been succesfully indexed by GloBI, the GloBI Index
Status Badge will turn green. This means that the dataset under review
was indexed by GloBI and is available through GloBI services and derived
data products.

Discussion

This review and archive provides a means of creating citable versions
of datasets that change frequently. This may be useful for dataset
managers, including natural history collection data managers, as a
backup archive of a shared Darwin Core archive. It also serves as a
means of creating a trackable citation for the dataset in an automated
way, while also including some information about the contents of the
dataset.

This review aims to provide a perspective on the dataset to aid in
understanding of species interaction claims discovered. However, it is
important to note that this review does not assess the quality
of the dataset. Instead, it serves as an indication of the open-ness6 and FAIRness (Wilkinson et
al. 2016; Trekels et al. 2023) of the dataset: to perform this
review, the data was likely openly available, Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable and
Reusable. The current Open-FAIR assessment is
qualitative, and a more quantitative approach can be implemented with
specified measurement units.

This report also showcases the reuse of machine-actionable
(meta)data, something highly recommended by the FAIR Data Principles
(Wilkinson et al.
2016). Making (meta)data machine-actionable enables more precise
procesing by computers, enabling even naive review bots like Nomer and
Elton to interpret the data effectively. This capability is crucial for
not just automating the generation of reports, but also for facilitating
seamless data exchanges, promoting interoperability.

AB  - Introduction

Data Review and Archive

Data review and archiving can be a time-consuming process, especially
when done manually. This review report aims to help facilitate both
activities. It automates the archiving of datasets, including Darwin
Core archives, and is a citable backup of a version of the dataset.
Additionally, an automatic review of species interaction claims made in
the dataset is generated and registered with Global Biotic Interactions
(J. H. Poelen, Simons,
and Mungall 2014).

This review includes summary statistics about, and observations
about, the dataset under review:

Biotic Interactions




Biotic Interaction Data
Model


In this review, biotic interactions (or biotic associations) are
modeled as a primary (aka subject, source) organism interacting with an
associate (aka object, target) organism. The dataset under review
classified the primary/associate organisms with specific taxa. The
primary and associate organisms The kind of interaction is documented as
an interaction type.

The dataset under review, named
globalbioticinteractions/knowledgepixels, has fingerprint
hash://md5/db262b7af2bbdd32cee91e3e046ef0af, is 60.0KiB in size and
contains 96 interactions with 4 unique types of associations (e.g.,
eats) between 41 primary taxa (e.g., Epilissus splendidus Fairmaire,
1889 (species)) and 17 associated taxa (e.g., Marmota (Marmota) bobak
(Müller, 1776) (species)).

An exhaustive list of indexed interaction claims can be found in
gzipped csv and tsv archives. To facilitate
discovery, a preview of claims available in the gzipped html page at indexed-interactions.html.gz are
shown below.

The exhaustive list was used to create the following data summaries
below.

Additional Reviews

Elton, Nomer, and other tools may have difficulties interpreting
existing species interaction datasets. Or, they may misbehave, or
otherwise show unexpected behavior. As part of the review process,
detailed review notes are kept that document possibly misbehaving, or
confused, review bots. An sample of review notes associated with this
review can be found below.

Note that if the badge is green, no review notes were generated. If
the badge is yellow, the review bots may need some help with
interpreting the species interaction data.

GloBI Index Badge

If the dataset under review has been registered with
GloBI, and has been succesfully indexed by GloBI, the GloBI Index
Status Badge will turn green. This means that the dataset under review
was indexed by GloBI and is available through GloBI services and derived
data products.

Discussion

This review and archive provides a means of creating citable versions
of datasets that change frequently. This may be useful for dataset
managers, including natural history collection data managers, as a
backup archive of a shared Darwin Core archive. It also serves as a
means of creating a trackable citation for the dataset in an automated
way, while also including some information about the contents of the
dataset.

This review aims to provide a perspective on the dataset to aid in
understanding of species interaction claims discovered. However, it is
important to note that this review does not assess the quality
of the dataset. Instead, it serves as an indication of the open-ness6 and FAIRness (Wilkinson et
al. 2016; Trekels et al. 2023) of the dataset: to perform this
review, the data was likely openly available, Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable and
Reusable. The current Open-FAIR assessment is
qualitative, and a more quantitative approach can be implemented with
specified measurement units.

This report also showcases the reuse of machine-actionable
(meta)data, something highly recommended by the FAIR Data Principles
(Wilkinson et al.
2016). Making (meta)data machine-actionable enables more precise
procesing by computers, enabling even naive review bots like Nomer and
Elton to interpret the data effectively. This capability is crucial for
not just automating the generation of reports, but also for facilitating
seamless data exchanges, promoting interoperability.

Acknowledgements

AB  - Introduction

Data Review and Archive

Data review and archiving can be a time-consuming process, especially
when done manually. This review report aims to help facilitate both
activities. It automates the archiving of datasets, including Darwin
Core archives, and is a citable backup of a version of the dataset.
Additionally, an automatic review of species interaction claims made in
the dataset is generated and registered with Global Biotic Interactions
(J. H. Poelen, Simons,
and Mungall 2014).

This review includes summary statistics about, and observations
about, the dataset under review:

Biotic Interactions




Biotic Interaction Data
Model


In this review, biotic interactions (or biotic associations) are
modeled as a primary (aka subject, source) organism interacting with an
associate (aka object, target) organism. The dataset under review
classified the primary/associate organisms with specific taxa. The
primary and associate organisms The kind of interaction is documented as
an interaction type.

The dataset under review, named globalbioticinteractions/mpm, has
fingerprint hash://md5/0cb785ba9ceef583d6b9a9071ad0c225, is 18.1MiB in
size and contains 666 interactions with 3 unique types of associations
(e.g., interactsWith) between 230 primary taxa (e.g., Anisota senatoria)
and 307 associated taxa (e.g., At flowers.).

An exhaustive list of indexed interaction claims can be found in
gzipped csv and tsv archives. To facilitate
discovery, a preview of claims available in the gzipped html page at indexed-interactions.html.gz are
shown below.

The exhaustive list was used to create the following data summaries
below.

Additional Reviews

Elton, Nomer, and other tools may have difficulties interpreting
existing species interaction datasets. Or, they may misbehave, or
otherwise show unexpected behavior. As part of the review process,
detailed review notes are kept that document possibly misbehaving, or
confused, review bots. An sample of review notes associated with this

Discussion

This review and archive provides a means of creating citable versions
of datasets that change frequently. This may be useful for dataset
managers, including natural history collection data managers, as a
backup archive of a shared Darwin Core archive. It also serves as a
means of creating a trackable citation for the dataset in an automated
way, while also including some information about the contents of the
dataset.

This review aims to provide a perspective on the dataset to aid in
understanding of species interaction claims discovered. However, it is
important to note that this review does not assess the quality
of the dataset. Instead, it serves as an indication of the open-ness6 and FAIRness (Wilkinson et
al. 2016; Trekels et al. 2023) of the dataset: to perform this
review, the data was likely openly available, Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable and
Reusable. The current Open-FAIR assessment is
qualitative, and a more quantitative approach can be implemented with
specified measurement units.

This report also showcases the reuse of machine-actionable
(meta)data, something highly recommended by the FAIR Data Principles
(Wilkinson et al.
2016). Making (meta)data machine-actionable enables more precise
procesing by computers, enabling even naive review bots like Nomer and
Elton to interpret the data effectively. This capability is crucial for
not just automating the generation of reports, but also for facilitating
seamless data exchanges, promoting interoperability.

AB  - Introduction

Data Review and Archive

Data review and archiving can be a time-consuming process, especially
when done manually. This review report aims to help facilitate both
activities. It automates the archiving of datasets, including Darwin
Core archives, and is a citable backup of a version of the dataset.
Additionally, an automatic review of species interaction claims made in
the dataset is generated and registered with Global Biotic Interactions
(J. H. Poelen, Simons,
and Mungall 2014).

This review includes summary statistics about, and observations
about, the dataset under review:

Biotic Interactions




Biotic Interaction Data
Model


In this review, biotic interactions (or biotic associations) are
modeled as a primary (aka subject, source) organism interacting with an
associate (aka object, target) organism. The dataset under review
classified the primary/associate organisms with specific taxa. The
primary and associate organisms The kind of interaction is documented as
an interaction type.

The dataset under review, named globalbioticinteractions/mycoportal,
has fingerprint hash://md5/23d7d00bc7f8662173d1efc3f4fb8352, is 403MiB
in size and contains 1,893,988 interaction with 6 unique types of
associations (e.g., hasHost) between 117,223 primary taxon (e.g.,
Erysiphe cichoracearum) and 173,267 associated taxon (e.g., Substrate
Undetermined).

An exhaustive list of indexed interaction claims can be found in
gzipped csv and tsv archives. To facilitate
discovery, a preview of claims available in the gzipped html page at indexed-interactions.html.gz are
shown below.

The exhaustive list was used to create the following data summaries
below.

Interaction Networks

The figures below provide a graph view on the dataset under review.
The first shows a summary network on the kingdom level, and the second
shows how interactions on the family level. It is important to note that
both network graphs were first aligned taxonomically using the Catalogue
of Life. Please refer to the original (or verbatim) taxonomic names for
a more original view on the interaction data.

Taxonomic Alignment

As part of the review, all names are aligned against various name
catalogs (e.g., col, ncbi, discoverlife, gbif, itis, wfo, mdd, tpt,
pbdb, and worms). These alignments can help review name usage or aid in
selecting of a suitable taxonomic name resource.

first 500 Review Notes in html format
or the download full gzipped csv or tsv archives.

GloBI Review Badge

As part of the review, a review badge is generated. This review badge
can be included in webpages to indicate the review status of the dataset
under review.




Picture of a GloBI Review Badge 3


Note that if the badge is green, no review notes were generated. If
the badge is yellow, the review bots may need some help with
interpreting the species interaction data.

GloBI Index Badge

If the dataset under review has been registered with
GloBI, and has been succesfully indexed by GloBI, the GloBI Index
Status Badge will turn green. This means that the dataset under review
was indexed by GloBI and is available through GloBI services and derived
data products.

Discussion

This review and archive provides a means of creating citable versions
of datasets that change frequently. This may be useful for dataset
managers, including natural history collection data managers, as a
backup archive of a shared Darwin Core archive. It also serves as a
means of creating a trackable citation for the dataset in an automated
way, while also including some information about the contents of the
dataset.

This review aims to provide a perspective on the dataset to aid in
understanding of species interaction claims discovered. However, it is
important to note that this review does not assess the quality
of the dataset. Instead, it serves as an indication of the open-ness6 and FAIRness (Wilkinson et
al. 2016; Trekels et al. 2023) of the dataset: to perform this
review, the data was likely openly available, Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable and
Reusable. The current Open-FAIR assessment is
qualitative, and a more quantitative approach can be implemented with
specified measurement units.

This report also showcases the reuse of machine-actionable
(meta)data, something highly recommended by the FAIR Data Principles
(Wilkinson et al.
2016). Making (meta)data machine-actionable enables more precise
procesing by computers, enabling even naive review bots like Nomer and
Elton to interpret the data effectively. This capability is crucial for
not just automating the generation of reports, but also for facilitating
seamless data exchanges, promoting interoperability.

Acknowledgements

We thank the many humans that created us and those who created and
maintained the data, software and other intellectual resources that were
used for producing this review. In addition, we are grateful for the
natural resources providing the basis for these human and bot
activities. Also, thanks to https://github.com/zygoballus for helping
improve the layout of the review tables.

AB  - Introduction

Data Review and Archive

Data review and archiving can be a time-consuming process, especially
when done manually. This review report aims to help facilitate both
activities. It automates the archiving of datasets, including Darwin
Core archives, and is a citable backup of a version of the dataset.
Additionally, an automatic review of species interaction claims made in
the dataset is generated and registered with Global Biotic Interactions
(J. H. Poelen, Simons,
and Mungall 2014).

This review includes summary statistics about, and observations
about, the dataset under review:

Biotic Interactions




Biotic Interaction Data
Model


In this review, biotic interactions (or biotic associations) are
modeled as a primary (aka subject, source) organism interacting with an
associate (aka object, target) organism. The dataset under review
classified the primary/associate organisms with specific taxa. The
primary and associate organisms The kind of interaction is documented as
an interaction type.

The dataset under review, named globalbioticinteractions/paz2021, has
fingerprint hash://md5/b625ec71acea9ebdc28aa89e2ce6b293, is 103KiB in
size and contains 239 interactions with 2 unique types of associations
(e.g., eatenBy) between 188 primary taxa (e.g., Acrocomia sclerocarpa
Mart.) and 29 associated taxa (e.g., Homo sapiens).

An exhaustive list of indexed interaction claims can be found in
gzipped csv and tsv archives. To facilitate
discovery, a preview of claims available in the gzipped html page at indexed-interactions.html.gz are
shown below.

The exhaustive list was used to create the following data summaries
below.

Interaction Networks

The figures below provide a graph view on the dataset under review.
The first shows a summary network on the kingdom level, and the second
shows how interactions on the family level. It is important to note that
both network graphs were first aligned taxonomically using the Catalogue
of Life. Please refer to the original (or verbatim) taxonomic names for
a more original view on the interaction data.

Discussion

This review and archive provides a means of creating citable versions
of datasets that change frequently. This may be useful for dataset
managers, including natural history collection data managers, as a
backup archive of a shared Darwin Core archive. It also serves as a
means of creating a trackable citation for the dataset in an automated
way, while also including some information about the contents of the
dataset.

This review aims to provide a perspective on the dataset to aid in
understanding of species interaction claims discovered. However, it is
important to note that this review does not assess the quality
of the dataset. Instead, it serves as an indication of the open-ness6 and FAIRness (Wilkinson et
al. 2016; Trekels et al. 2023) of the dataset: to perform this
review, the data was likely openly available, Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable and
Reusable. The current Open-FAIR assessment is
qualitative, and a more quantitative approach can be implemented with
specified measurement units.

This report also showcases the reuse of machine-actionable
(meta)data, something highly recommended by the FAIR Data Principles
(Wilkinson et al.
2016). Making (meta)data machine-actionable enables more precise
procesing by computers, enabling even naive review bots like Nomer and
Elton to interpret the data effectively. This capability is crucial for
not just automating the generation of reports, but also for facilitating
seamless data exchanges, promoting interoperability.

AB  - Introduction

Data Review and Archive

Data review and archiving can be a time-consuming process, especially
when done manually. This review report aims to help facilitate both
activities. It automates the archiving of datasets, including Darwin
Core archives, and is a citable backup of a version of the dataset.
Additionally, an automatic review of species interaction claims made in
the dataset is generated and registered with Global Biotic Interactions
(J. H. Poelen, Simons,
and Mungall 2014).

This review includes summary statistics about, and observations
about, the dataset under review:

Biotic Interactions




Biotic Interaction Data
Model


In this review, biotic interactions (or biotic associations) are
modeled as a primary (aka subject, source) organism interacting with an
associate (aka object, target) organism. The dataset under review
classified the primary/associate organisms with specific taxa. The
primary and associate organisms The kind of interaction is documented as
an interaction type.

The dataset under review, named globalbioticinteractions/saproxylic,
has fingerprint hash://md5/7145c8edf511a3fd46a1c1b7f2a65cfa, is 27.0MiB
in size and contains 25,838 interaction with 7 unique types of
associations (e.g., hostOf) between 1,346 primary taxon (e.g.,
Oodinychus ovalis) and 1,346 associated taxon (e.g., Oodinychus
ovalis).

An exhaustive list of indexed interaction claims can be found in
gzipped csv and tsv archives. To facilitate
discovery, a preview of claims available in the gzipped html page at indexed-interactions.html.gz are
shown below.

The exhaustive list was used to create the following data summaries
below.

Discussion

This review and archive provides a means of creating citable versions
of datasets that change frequently. This may be useful for dataset
managers, including natural history collection data managers, as a
backup archive of a shared Darwin Core archive. It also serves as a
means of creating a trackable citation for the dataset in an automated
way, while also including some information about the contents of the
dataset.

This review aims to provide a perspective on the dataset to aid in
understanding of species interaction claims discovered. However, it is
important to note that this review does not assess the quality
of the dataset. Instead, it serves as an indication of the open-ness6 and FAIRness (Wilkinson et
al. 2016; Trekels et al. 2023) of the dataset: to perform this
review, the data was likely openly available, Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable and
Reusable. The current Open-FAIR assessment is
qualitative, and a more quantitative approach can be implemented with
specified measurement units.

This report also showcases the reuse of machine-actionable
(meta)data, something highly recommended by the FAIR Data Principles
(Wilkinson et al.
2016). Making (meta)data machine-actionable enables more precise
procesing by computers, enabling even naive review bots like Nomer and
Elton to interpret the data effectively. This capability is crucial for
not just automating the generation of reports, but also for facilitating
seamless data exchanges, promoting interoperability.

AB  - Introduction

Data Review and Archive

Data review and archiving can be a time-consuming process, especially
when done manually. This review report aims to help facilitate both
activities. It automates the archiving of datasets, including Darwin
Core archives, and is a citable backup of a version of the dataset.
Additionally, an automatic review of species interaction claims made in
the dataset is generated and registered with Global Biotic Interactions
(J. H. Poelen, Simons,
and Mungall 2014).

This review includes summary statistics about, and observations
about, the dataset under review:



Web interactions bewteen insects and some common plants in the
"Refugio de Vida Silvestre Alto de San Miguel".

Biotic Interactions




Biotic Interaction Data
Model


In this review, biotic interactions (or biotic associations) are
modeled as a primary (aka subject, source) organism interacting with an
associate (aka object, target) organism. The dataset under review
classified the primary/associate organisms with specific taxa. The
primary and associate organisms The kind of interaction is documented as
an interaction type.

The dataset under review, named
globalbioticinteractions/sib-colombia, has fingerprint
hash://md5/065f14b4a9d14804ff787195d47bb62c, is 194KiB in size and
contains 21 interactions with 3 unique types of associations (e.g.,
visitedBy) between 9 primary taxa (e.g., Xanthosoma) and 11 associated
taxa (e.g., Cyclocephala tutilina Burmeister, 1847).

An exhaustive list of indexed interaction claims can be found in
gzipped csv and tsv archives. To facilitate
discovery, a preview of claims available in the gzipped html page at indexed-interactions.html.gz are
shown below.

The exhaustive list was used to create the following data summaries
below.

Additional Reviews

Elton, Nomer, and other tools may have difficulties interpreting
existing species interaction datasets. Or, they may misbehave, or
otherwise show unexpected behavior. As part of the review process,
detailed review notes are kept that document possibly misbehaving, or
confused, review bots. An sample of review notes associated with this
review can be found below.

Note that if the badge is green, no review notes were generated. If
the badge is yellow, the review bots may need some help with
interpreting the species interaction data.

GloBI Index Badge

If the dataset under review has been registered with
GloBI, and has been succesfully indexed by GloBI, the GloBI Index
Status Badge will turn green. This means that the dataset under review
was indexed by GloBI and is available through GloBI services and derived
data products.

Discussion

This review and archive provides a means of creating citable versions
of datasets that change frequently. This may be useful for dataset
managers, including natural history collection data managers, as a
backup archive of a shared Darwin Core archive. It also serves as a
means of creating a trackable citation for the dataset in an automated
way, while also including some information about the contents of the
dataset.

This review aims to provide a perspective on the dataset to aid in
understanding of species interaction claims discovered. However, it is
important to note that this review does not assess the quality
of the dataset. Instead, it serves as an indication of the open-ness6 and FAIRness (Wilkinson et
al. 2016; Trekels et al. 2023) of the dataset: to perform this
review, the data was likely openly available, Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable and
Reusable. The current Open-FAIR assessment is
qualitative, and a more quantitative approach can be implemented with
specified measurement units.

This report also showcases the reuse of machine-actionable
(meta)data, something highly recommended by the FAIR Data Principles
(Wilkinson et al.
2016). Making (meta)data machine-actionable enables more precise
procesing by computers, enabling even naive review bots like Nomer and
Elton to interpret the data effectively. This capability is crucial for
not just automating the generation of reports, but also for facilitating
seamless data exchanges, promoting interoperability.

AB  - Introduction

Data Review and Archive

Data review and archiving can be a time-consuming process, especially
when done manually. This review report aims to help facilitate both
activities. It automates the archiving of datasets, including Darwin
Core archives, and is a citable backup of a version of the dataset.
Additionally, an automatic review of species interaction claims made in
the dataset is generated and registered with Global Biotic Interactions
(J. H. Poelen, Simons,
and Mungall 2014).

This review includes summary statistics about, and observations
about, the dataset under review:

Biotic Interactions




Biotic Interaction Data
Model


In this review, biotic interactions (or biotic associations) are
modeled as a primary (aka subject, source) organism interacting with an
associate (aka object, target) organism. The dataset under review
classified the primary/associate organisms with specific taxa. The
primary and associate organisms The kind of interaction is documented as
an interaction type.

The dataset under review, named globalbioticinteractions/strong2014,
has fingerprint hash://md5/2f5101368929c38e851e7d0632de04f2, is 862KiB
in size and contains 2,192 interaction with 1 unique type of association
(e.g., eats) between 28 primary taxa (e.g., North American deermouse)
and 500 associated taxa (e.g., American moose).

An exhaustive list of indexed interaction claims can be found in
gzipped csv and tsv archives. To facilitate
discovery, a preview of claims available in the gzipped html page at indexed-interactions.html.gz are
shown below.

The exhaustive list was used to create the following data summaries
below.

Taxonomic Alignment

As part of the review, all names are aligned against various name
catalogs (e.g., col, ncbi, discoverlife, gbif, itis, wfo, mdd, tpt,
pbdb, and worms). These alignments can help review name usage or aid in
selecting of a suitable taxonomic name resource.

Additional Reviews

Elton, Nomer, and other tools may have difficulties interpreting
existing species interaction datasets. Or, they may misbehave, or
otherwise show unexpected behavior. As part of the review process,
detailed review notes are kept that document possibly misbehaving, or
confused, review bots. An sample of review notes associated with this
review can be found below.

Note that if the badge is green, no review notes were generated. If
the badge is yellow, the review bots may need some help with
interpreting the species interaction data.

GloBI Index Badge

If the dataset under review has been registered with
GloBI, and has been succesfully indexed by GloBI, the GloBI Index
Status Badge will turn green. This means that the dataset under review
was indexed by GloBI and is available through GloBI services and derived
data products.

Discussion

This review and archive provides a means of creating citable versions
of datasets that change frequently. This may be useful for dataset
managers, including natural history collection data managers, as a
backup archive of a shared Darwin Core archive. It also serves as a
means of creating a trackable citation for the dataset in an automated
way, while also including some information about the contents of the
dataset.

This review aims to provide a perspective on the dataset to aid in
understanding of species interaction claims discovered. However, it is
important to note that this review does not assess the quality
of the dataset. Instead, it serves as an indication of the open-ness6 and FAIRness (Wilkinson et
al. 2016; Trekels et al. 2023) of the dataset: to perform this
review, the data was likely openly available, Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable and
Reusable. The current Open-FAIR assessment is
qualitative, and a more quantitative approach can be implemented with
specified measurement units.

This report also showcases the reuse of machine-actionable
(meta)data, something highly recommended by the FAIR Data Principles
(Wilkinson et al.
2016). Making (meta)data machine-actionable enables more precise
procesing by computers, enabling even naive review bots like Nomer and
Elton to interpret the data effectively. This capability is crucial for
not just automating the generation of reports, but also for facilitating
seamless data exchanges, promoting interoperability.

AB  - Introduction

Data Review and Archive

Data review and archiving can be a time-consuming process, especially
when done manually. This review report aims to help facilitate both
activities. It automates the archiving of datasets, including Darwin
Core archives, and is a citable backup of a version of the dataset.
Additionally, an automatic review of species interaction claims made in
the dataset is generated and registered with Global Biotic Interactions
(J. H. Poelen, Simons,
and Mungall 2014).

This review includes summary statistics about, and observations
about, the dataset under review:

Biotic Interactions




Biotic Interaction Data
Model


In this review, biotic interactions (or biotic associations) are
modeled as a primary (aka subject, source) organism interacting with an
associate (aka object, target) organism. The dataset under review
classified the primary/associate organisms with specific taxa. The
primary and associate organisms The kind of interaction is documented as
an interaction type.

The dataset under review, named globalbioticinteractions/ut-utbfl,
has fingerprint hash://md5/ce7c1cafe20efa21735387b302a05912, is 87.4KiB
in size and contains 566 interactions with 1 unique type of association
(e.g., interactsWith) between 89 primary taxa (e.g., Svastra petulca)
and 35 associated taxa (e.g., Gaillardia pulchella Foug.).

An exhaustive list of indexed interaction claims can be found in
gzipped csv and tsv archives. To facilitate
discovery, a preview of claims available in the gzipped html page at indexed-interactions.html.gz are
shown below.

The exhaustive list was used to create the following data summaries
below.

Discussion

This review and archive provides a means of creating citable versions
of datasets that change frequently. This may be useful for dataset
managers, including natural history collection data managers, as a
backup archive of a shared Darwin Core archive. It also serves as a
means of creating a trackable citation for the dataset in an automated
way, while also including some information about the contents of the
dataset.

This review aims to provide a perspective on the dataset to aid in
understanding of species interaction claims discovered. However, it is
important to note that this review does not assess the quality
of the dataset. Instead, it serves as an indication of the open-ness6 and FAIRness (Wilkinson et
al. 2016; Trekels et al. 2023) of the dataset: to perform this
review, the data was likely openly available, Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable and
Reusable. The current Open-FAIR assessment is
qualitative, and a more quantitative approach can be implemented with
specified measurement units.

This report also showcases the reuse of machine-actionable
(meta)data, something highly recommended by the FAIR Data Principles
(Wilkinson et al.
2016). Making (meta)data machine-actionable enables more precise
procesing by computers, enabling even naive review bots like Nomer and
Elton to interpret the data effectively. This capability is crucial for
not just automating the generation of reports, but also for facilitating
seamless data exchanges, promoting interoperability.

AB  - Introduction

Data Review and Archive

Data review and archiving can be a time-consuming process, especially
when done manually. This review report aims to help facilitate both
activities. It automates the archiving of datasets, including Darwin
Core archives, and is a citable backup of a version of the dataset.
Additionally, an automatic review of species interaction claims made in
the dataset is generated and registered with Global Biotic Interactions
(J. H. Poelen, Simons,
and Mungall 2014).

This review includes summary statistics about, and observations
about, the dataset under review:

Biotic Interactions




Biotic Interaction Data
Model


In this review, biotic interactions (or biotic associations) are
modeled as a primary (aka subject, source) organism interacting with an
associate (aka object, target) organism. The dataset under review
classified the primary/associate organisms with specific taxa. The
primary and associate organisms The kind of interaction is documented as
an interaction type.

The dataset under review, named ibartomeus/OBservData, has
fingerprint hash://md5/35b1210f8b22088babe73b2b9012c15e, is 77.2MiB in
size and contains 54,191 interaction with 1 unique type of association
(e.g., pollinatedBy) between 46 primary taxa (e.g., Malus domestica) and
2,961 associated taxon (e.g., Apis mellifera).

An exhaustive list of indexed interaction claims can be found in
gzipped csv and tsv archives. To facilitate
discovery, a preview of claims available in the gzipped html page at indexed-interactions.html.gz are
shown below.

The exhaustive list was used to create the following data summaries
below.

Additional Reviews

Elton, Nomer, and other tools may have difficulties interpreting
existing species interaction datasets. Or, they may misbehave, or
otherwise show unexpected behavior. As part of the review process,
detailed review notes are kept that document possibly misbehaving, or
confused, review bots. An sample of review notes associated with this
review can be found below.

Discussion

This review and archive provides a means of creating citable versions
of datasets that change frequently. This may be useful for dataset
managers, including natural history collection data managers, as a
backup archive of a shared Darwin Core archive. It also serves as a
means of creating a trackable citation for the dataset in an automated
way, while also including some information about the contents of the
dataset.

This review aims to provide a perspective on the dataset to aid in
understanding of species interaction claims discovered. However, it is
important to note that this review does not assess the quality
of the dataset. Instead, it serves as an indication of the open-ness6 and FAIRness (Wilkinson et
al. 2016; Trekels et al. 2023) of the dataset: to perform this
review, the data was likely openly available, Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable and
Reusable. The current Open-FAIR assessment is
qualitative, and a more quantitative approach can be implemented with
specified measurement units.

This report also showcases the reuse of machine-actionable
(meta)data, something highly recommended by the FAIR Data Principles
(Wilkinson et al.
2016). Making (meta)data machine-actionable enables more precise
procesing by computers, enabling even naive review bots like Nomer and
Elton to interpret the data effectively. This capability is crucial for
not just automating the generation of reports, but also for facilitating
seamless data exchanges, promoting interoperability.

AB  - Introduction

Data Review and Archive

Data review and archiving can be a time-consuming process, especially
when done manually. This review report aims to help facilitate both
activities. It automates the archiving of datasets, including Darwin
Core archives, and is a citable backup of a version of the dataset.
Additionally, an automatic review of species interaction claims made in
the dataset is generated and registered with Global Biotic Interactions
(J. H. Poelen, Simons,
and Mungall 2014).

This review includes summary statistics about, and observations
about, the dataset under review:



Sarah E Miller. 06/10/2015. Species associations manually extracted
from Chamberlin, W. J. The Buprestidae of North America, Exclusive of
Mexico, a Catalogue including Synonomy, Bibliography, Distribution, Type
Locality and Hosts of Each Species,. 1926.

Biotic Interactions




Biotic Interaction Data
Model


In this review, biotic interactions (or biotic associations) are
modeled as a primary (aka subject, source) organism interacting with an
associate (aka object, target) organism. The dataset under review
classified the primary/associate organisms with specific taxa. The
primary and associate organisms The kind of interaction is documented as
an interaction type.

The dataset under review, named
millerse/Buprestidae-of-North-America, has fingerprint
hash://md5/7d2a513ae776958227c5e499115d38c1, is 7.92MiB in size and
contains 22,882 interaction with 2 unique types of associations (e.g.,
parasiteOf) between 260 primary taxa (e.g., Chrysobothris mali) and 333
associated taxa (e.g., Pinus ponderosa).

An exhaustive list of indexed interaction claims can be found in
gzipped csv and tsv archives. To facilitate
discovery, a preview of claims available in the gzipped html page at indexed-interactions.html.gz are
shown below.

The exhaustive list was used to create the following data summaries
below.

Additional Reviews

Elton, Nomer, and other tools may have difficulties interpreting
existing species interaction datasets. Or, they may misbehave, or
otherwise show unexpected behavior. As part of the review process,
detailed review notes are kept that document possibly misbehaving, or
confused, review bots. An sample of review notes associated with this
review can be found below.

Note that if the badge is green, no review notes were generated. If
the badge is yellow, the review bots may need some help with
interpreting the species interaction data.

GloBI Index Badge

If the dataset under review has been registered with
GloBI, and has been succesfully indexed by GloBI, the GloBI Index
Status Badge will turn green. This means that the dataset under review
was indexed by GloBI and is available through GloBI services and derived
data products.

Discussion

This review and archive provides a means of creating citable versions
of datasets that change frequently. This may be useful for dataset
managers, including natural history collection data managers, as a
backup archive of a shared Darwin Core archive. It also serves as a
means of creating a trackable citation for the dataset in an automated
way, while also including some information about the contents of the
dataset.

This review aims to provide a perspective on the dataset to aid in
understanding of species interaction claims discovered. However, it is
important to note that this review does not assess the quality
of the dataset. Instead, it serves as an indication of the open-ness6 and FAIRness (Wilkinson et
al. 2016; Trekels et al. 2023) of the dataset: to perform this
review, the data was likely openly available, Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable and
Reusable. The current Open-FAIR assessment is
qualitative, and a more quantitative approach can be implemented with
specified measurement units.

This report also showcases the reuse of machine-actionable
(meta)data, something highly recommended by the FAIR Data Principles
(Wilkinson et al.
2016). Making (meta)data machine-actionable enables more precise
procesing by computers, enabling even naive review bots like Nomer and
Elton to interpret the data effectively. This capability is crucial for
not just automating the generation of reports, but also for facilitating
seamless data exchanges, promoting interoperability.

Acknowledgements

AB  - Introduction

Data Review and Archive

Data review and archiving can be a time-consuming process, especially
when done manually. This review report aims to help facilitate both
activities. It automates the archiving of datasets, including Darwin
Core archives, and is a citable backup of a version of the dataset.
Additionally, an automatic review of species interaction claims made in
the dataset is generated and registered with Global Biotic Interactions
(J. H. Poelen, Simons,
and Mungall 2014).

This review includes summary statistics about, and observations
about, the dataset under review:

Biotic Interactions




Biotic Interaction Data
Model


In this review, biotic interactions (or biotic associations) are
modeled as a primary (aka subject, source) organism interacting with an
associate (aka object, target) organism. The dataset under review
classified the primary/associate organisms with specific taxa. The
primary and associate organisms The kind of interaction is documented as
an interaction type.

The dataset under review, named pensoft/pensoft-interaction-tables,
has fingerprint hash://md5/214a21ac0f8ee1f2a10c4a8e47367d6b, is 822KiB
in size and contains 160 interactions with 1 unique type of association
(e.g., hostOf) between 96 primary taxa (e.g., Rosa) and 88 associated
taxa (e.g., Thrips parvispinus).

An exhaustive list of indexed interaction claims can be found in
gzipped csv and tsv archives. To facilitate
discovery, a preview of claims available in the gzipped html page at indexed-interactions.html.gz are
shown below.

The exhaustive list was used to create the following data summaries
below.

Additional Reviews

Elton, Nomer, and other tools may have difficulties interpreting
existing species interaction datasets. Or, they may misbehave, or
otherwise show unexpected behavior. As part of the review process,
detailed review notes are kept that document possibly misbehaving, or
confused, review bots. An sample of review notes associated with this
review can be found below.

GloBI Review Badge

As part of the review, a review badge is generated. This review badge
can be included in webpages to indicate the review status of the dataset
under review.




Picture of a GloBI Review Badge 3


Note that if the badge is green, no review notes were generated. If
the badge is yellow, the review bots may need some help with
interpreting the species interaction data.

GloBI Index Badge

If the dataset under review has been registered with
GloBI, and has been succesfully indexed by GloBI, the GloBI Index
Status Badge will turn green. This means that the dataset under review
was indexed by GloBI and is available through GloBI services and derived
data products.

Discussion

This review and archive provides a means of creating citable versions
of datasets that change frequently. This may be useful for dataset
managers, including natural history collection data managers, as a
backup archive of a shared Darwin Core archive. It also serves as a
means of creating a trackable citation for the dataset in an automated
way, while also including some information about the contents of the
dataset.

This review aims to provide a perspective on the dataset to aid in
understanding of species interaction claims discovered. However, it is
important to note that this review does not assess the quality
of the dataset. Instead, it serves as an indication of the open-ness6 and FAIRness (Wilkinson et
al. 2016; Trekels et al. 2023) of the dataset: to perform this
review, the data was likely openly available, Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable and
Reusable. The current Open-FAIR assessment is
qualitative, and a more quantitative approach can be implemented with
specified measurement units.

This report also showcases the reuse of machine-actionable
(meta)data, something highly recommended by the FAIR Data Principles
(Wilkinson et al.
2016). Making (meta)data machine-actionable enables more precise
procesing by computers, enabling even naive review bots like Nomer and
Elton to interpret the data effectively. This capability is crucial for
not just automating the generation of reports, but also for facilitating
seamless data exchanges, promoting interoperability.
