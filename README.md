# GloBI Review Corpus

To help make species interaction datasets easier to access, Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI, https://globalbioticinteractions.org) reviews existing datasets and makes their associated review reports available via https://zenodo.org/community/globi-review . 

This repository tracks these review reports and offers tools to access the species interaction datasets under review.
